I had trouble creating a new branch and merging them in GitHub.
I do not use GitHub to often and had to learn how to merge branch files.

Sources: I used the lecture video as well as https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches
